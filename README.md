# Tech Blog

## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This project gave me the opportunity to work on the following skills:

- Creating a server and database
- MVC paradigm
- Using handlebars, sequelize, and express-session
- Creating routes

## Usage

From the homepage, users can view all posts that have been created. They can sign up or log in. When they do so, they are brought to their personal dashboard where they can view their own posts and create new ones. When they click on another users post from the homepage, they can view all the comments on that post or leave their own.
